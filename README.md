# Colimiter

We've all used a [limiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limiter) once in our lives. But have you ever seen an **inverse limiter**?

Colimiter will only let a signal through if it exceeds a specified peak. This check is done sample by sample.

- At low levels, this can create a subtle tape hiss effect. 
- At mid levels, the plugin acts like a distortion effect. 
- At high levels, the original sound will be transformed into crackles and
  clicks.

For best results, try using Colimiter on a highly dynamic signal. You can also try slowly raising the threshold to 0.0 dB as a harsh fade-out for a song.

I came up with this dumb idea in a dream.
